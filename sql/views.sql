-- =====================================================================
-- LISTING PACKAGE (gen-lang-client-0520145261.ctx_upside_master_data)
-- Feeds processes/new_listing_creation.yaml. The listing content itself is a
-- straight assembly job; what these views add is ACCURACY -- they normalise the
-- OCR'd nutrition panel, re-express it on both legal bases, check every on-pack
-- claim against the lab figure, and derive the allergens the recipe implies so an
-- under-declaration is caught before a marketplace ever sees it.
-- Order matters: NUTRIENT_CLEAN -> CLAIM_CHECK -> LISTING_PACKAGE.
-- =====================================================================

-- Canonical nutrition panel. PRODUCT_NUTRIENT is vision-OCR output, so the same
-- nutrient arrives as 'Total fat'/'total fat', 'Dietary fiber'/'Diatery fiber'/
-- 'Diaterary fiber', energy in 'Kcal'/'kcal'/'kcl', grams as 'g'/'gm' -- and the
-- panel's own header rows ('Amount per 100 gm', 'serving Size') leaked in as if they
-- were nutrients. This collapses the variants to one vocabulary, drops the headers,
-- and recovers from them the DECLARATION BASIS, without which no nutrition figure
-- can be published (14.71 g protein per 100 g and per 70 g serving are different
-- listings). Marks which nutrients FSSAI mandates and the legal print order.

-- Sales-gap diagnosis (processes/sales_gap_diagnosis.yaml) — THREE raw views.
--
-- The views hold RAW FACTS only. They do not flag, score or explain anything: the agent in
-- each diagnose step reads the rows and decides what moved and why. Deliberately NOT here:
-- dip/spike flags and driver hints (the agent decides), last-year comparison, inventory
-- (removed for now), KPT, store online availability, cancellations (silver.BUSINESS_ANALYTICS
-- has no 'Cancelled' rows), Swiggy marketing, competitor prices.
--
-- Split into three because a process step sees only ~9000 chars of its own fetch (hard cap,
-- assistant-backend event_agent.py): store x channel with every driver measured 14.7k, the
-- full Zomato funnel alone 10.3k. Each view feeds its own step(s) and stays under ~8.5k.
--
-- Shared rules (sales):
--   * Anchored on MAX(ORDER_DATE), never CURRENT_DATE() (the load runs a day behind).
--       CUR  = anchor-6  .. anchor     PREV = anchor-13 .. anchor-7     BASE = anchor-34 .. anchor-7
--   * The load has whole-day gaps (no rows at all for 23-24 Sep 2026), so PREV and BASE keep
--     only the weekdays that have sales in CUR, and every *_PREV / *_BASE value is SCALED to
--     DAYS_CUR days: SALES_CUR, SALES_PREV and SALES_BASE are directly comparable.
--   * Sales = UNIT_PRICE * QUANTITY (TOTAL/NET/DISCOUNT repeat per line); orders =
--     COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_ID); cancelled lines excluded.
--   * CHANNEL normalised to Zomato / Swiggy / Other.
--   * Store ids were reused (100010 Juhu->Fort, 100012 Malabar->Khar, 100025 Borivali->Dahisar);
--     STORE_NAME is the current MASTER_STORE name.

-- V_SALES_GAP_STORE — one row per store x channel, plus one 'All stores' row per channel.

--   Zomato rows only: SPEND_DAY_CUR/PREV (ad spend, Rs/day), ROI_CUR/PREV (ad sales / ad spend),
--     IMPR_DAY_CUR/PREV (all impressions/day), M2O_CUR/PREV (all orders / menu opens, %),
--     MKT_DAYS_CUR, MKT_WEEK_END. Marketing has its own anchor (it lags sales) and is per
--     LOADED day (it has whole-day gaps too). Full funnel: V_SALES_GAP_ZOMATO_MKT.
--   Store-level (same value on each of the store's channel rows — do NOT add across channels;
--     on 'All stores' rows = all stores): COMPLAINTS_CUR/PREV (distinct complained orders, all
--     platforms), REVIEWS_CUR, RATING_CUR (average stars this week).

-- V_SALES_GAP_PRODUCT — one row per product across all stores and channels.
--   SALES_CUR/PREV/BASE (Rs), UNITS_CUR/PREV/BASE, all scaled to DAYS_CUR days.
--   COMPLAINTS_CUR/PREV: distinct complained orders for this product, found by matching the
--     complaint's ORDER_ID to BUSINESS_ANALYTICS.ONLINE_ORDER_ID -> SKU. That link only exists
--     from Jul 2026 (30 of 33 complaints since then match; earlier months never do).
--   Unmapped items (SKU_ID 'UNKNOWN' / 'UNMAPPED' / blank: mostly hampers and gift boxes) are
--     kept, one row per item name, with SKU_ID = 'UNKNOWN'; the process filters them out.
--   No orders, AOV, marketing, reviews, weather, occasions or inventory: those are store-level.

--   Zomato only (Swiggy ads are not integrated). Own anchor: MAX(DATE) of marketing, which lags
--   sales; CUR = latest 7 days, PREV = the 7 before. Marketing has whole-day gaps (no rows at all
--   22-25 Sep 2026), so every *_DAY value is per LOADED day (MKT_DAYS_CUR / MKT_DAYS_PREV).
--   Campaign (latest marketing week): CAMPAIGNS (count), AD_TYPE (PSP / Visit Pack / ...),
--     TARGETING, SEGMENTS (segment names from MARKETING_SEGMENT_MASTER, e.g. "Ultra Modern").
--   Column legend (each as _CUR and _PREV):

--   Ratios are recomputed from summed numerators and denominators, never averaged from the
--   stored ROI / *_PCT columns. AD_* is SUM over campaign rows; TOTAL_* repeats per campaign
--   row, so it is MAX per restaurant-day first. Budget = DAILY_BOOKED_BUDGET_RS (current); the
